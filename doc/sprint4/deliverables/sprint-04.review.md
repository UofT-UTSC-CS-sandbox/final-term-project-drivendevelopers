   - **Why:** Improved our documentation habits significantly.
   - **Outcome:** Regularly updated and organized standup notes and deliverables, reducing confusion and ensuring all team members are aligned.

2. **Enhanced Task Management:**
   - **What:** Better organization of our JIRA board and task management.
   - **Why:** More detailed and accurate task descriptions and subtasks were added early in the sprint.
   - **Outcome:** Improved task visualization and accountability, leading to better tracking of progress and fewer missed details.

3. **Regular Online Meetings:**
   - **What:** Continued our daily online meetings at 5:30 pm on Zoom.
   - **Why:** Facilitated better communication and quick resolution of blockers.
   - **Outcome:** Allowed us to speed up our development and address issues promptly.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Pair Programming Scheduling Conflicts:**
   - **What:** Scheduling pair programming sessions as needed.
   - **Why:** Conflicts in availability led to fewer sessions than planned.
   - **Outcome:** Some coding efforts were less collaborative and effective.

2. **Overestimation of Feature Complexity:**
   - **What:** Overestimated the complexity of certain features.
   - **Why:** Led to unnecessary complications and extended development times.
   - **Outcome:** Some features were completed later than expected, causing delays in testing and integration.

### Planned Changes

1. **More Structured Pair Programming Sessions:**
   - **What:** Schedule pair programming sessions more rigidly.
   - **Why:** Ensure they occur regularly and consistently.
   - **Outcome:** Improve collaboration and code quality.

2. **Better Feature Complexity Assessment:**
   - **What:** Assess feature complexity more accurately during planning.
   - **Why:** Avoid unnecessary complications and manage development times better.
   - **Outcome:** More efficient development process and timely feature completion.
