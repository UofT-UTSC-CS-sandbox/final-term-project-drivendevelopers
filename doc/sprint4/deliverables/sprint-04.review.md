#### Participants
Hamza Khalid, Tammam Makki, Harish Thevakumaran


#### Decisions that turned out well

**More Purposeful Pair Programming Sessions:**

- **What:** Scheduling pair programming sessions with pre-defined goals.
- **Why:** Improved the efficiency of development.
- **Outcome:** Led to more productive sessions and quicker resolution of issues.

**Enhanced Code Reviews:**

- **What:** Conducting in-depth code reviews during standups.
- **Why:** Increased understanding of each other's code.
- **Outcome:** Improved overall code quality and teamwork.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

**Pair Programming Scheduling Conflicts:**

- **What:** Scheduling pair programming sessions as needed.
- **Why:** Conflicts in availability led to fewer sessions than planned.
- **Outcome:** Some coding efforts were less collaborative and effective.

**Overestimation of Feature Complexity:**

- **What:** Overestimated the complexity of certain features.
- **Why:** Led to unnecessary complications and extended development times.
- **Outcome:** Some features were completed later than expected, causing delays in testing and integration.
