# Edu Prodigi/Driven Developers

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: June 22nd, 2024
 * End date: July 4th, 2024

## Process

During our first meeting (planning meeting), we once again discussed the practices that we implemented in the previous sprint which we felt were not effective and possibly counter-productive. We then discussed alterantive or changed practices we could implement instead. Our hope is to patch some of the coordination and teamwork issues we experienced during our first development period, sprint 1.

#### Changes from previous iteration

1. **Scheduled Pair Programming Sessions:** - In this sprint we will schedule programming sessions with each other in pairs. Last sprint, we tried to have group coding sessions, which turned out to be extremely inefficient, as we were often discussing multiple topics at once. Our hope is that if we are working in pairs on a single feature at a time, it will be easier to remain focused and operate effectively. If we are able to leave a coding session, having completed one subtask, we can deem it successful.

2. **Stricter Documentation Practices:** - In this sprint, we will break our Jira tasks into smaller subtasks and also try to update our documentation more regulary. This includes regularly updating standup notes in the slack chat as well. Last sprint, our communication was very unorganized and it created many complications and confusions among us. By making this change we hope to be able to communicate more effectively, remain organized, and keep each other updated. If we are able to get through the entire sprint without having to have any meetings simply due to confusion among group members (as we did last sprint), we can dee it successful. 


#### Roles & responsibilities
- **Tamam Makki**: Responsible for the implementation of the user search feature and displaying a list of friends for the currently logged in user.
- **Harish Thevakumaran**: Responsible for implementing sending and accepting/declining friend requests among users.
- **Hamza Khalid**: Responsible for connection suggestion feature, where users are recommended other users to connect with based on their interests.



#### Events

**Online Meetings on Zoom:**
- **When:** Every weekday at 5:30 pm
- **Where:** Online via Zoom
- **Purpose:**
  - To understand each other's roles and responsibilities.
  - To identify and resolve blockers.
  - To track progress and ensure alignment with iteration goals.
  - To discuss any issues or challenges encountered during development.

**Scheduled Pair Programming Sessions**
- **When:** as needed throughout the sprint at 5:30 pm
- **Where:** Online via Zoom
- **Purpose:**
  - to speed up development and code quality by having two people discussing the code (its weaknesses, design, etc.) during its implementation


#### Artifacts

**To-do List:**
- **Purpose:** To keep track of individual tasks and ensure the needed attention is given to each task. 
- **Process:** We will be using a Google Docs document to make our to-do list. Each group member will have their own page where their taks will be listed. These tasks and who they were assigned to was decided upon in our planning meeting based on a general consensus (of who we felt could best complete the task).

**Task Boards:**
- **Purpose:** To visualize the progress of each of our tasks using Jira.
- **Process:** Each of the main features we are implementing have 1-2 tickets (user stories) created for them. Within these stories, we add subtasks in order to break down the task and keep track of its progress more accurately.

**Schedule:**
- **Purpose:** To manage deadlines and ensure timely completion of tasks.

**Meeting Notes:**
- **Purpose:** To document discussions and decisions made during meetings for future reference.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? Etc.

 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.

 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._


#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
