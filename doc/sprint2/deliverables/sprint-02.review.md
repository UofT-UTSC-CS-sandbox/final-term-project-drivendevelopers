# Edu Prodigi/DrivenDevelopers 

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect 
* **When:** July 4th, 2024 
* **Where:** Online via Zoom 

## Process - Reflection 
During this iteration, our team focused on enhancing social features for the Edu Prodigi platform, including friend requests, search functionality, and connection recommendations. 

#### Decisions that turned out well 
1. **Scheduled Pair Programming Sessions:** - Scheduling pair programming sessions in advance improved coordination and attendance, making our coding efforts more effective. This was much more effective than our group coding sessions which we attempted during sprint 1 of the project. With only two people at a time, there was less discussion about other parts of the project and we were able to remain focused on a single task at a time.

2. **Improved Documentation Practices:** - Implementing a more rigorous documentation process ensured that meeting notes and other important documents were updated regularly and stored in an easily accessible location. This also includes having our tasks on Jira broken down into subtasks, as this really allowed each of us to track each little bit of progress we each had made on each feature.

3. **Regular Online Meetings:** - Continuing our daily online meetings at 5:30 pm on Zoom facilitated better communication and quick resolution of blockers. Although there were certain aspects of our work habits (such as the group coding sessions) which we decided to change, continuing regular meetings was one which we felt needed to remain the same. Checking in with each other often allowed us to speed up our development and work on eliminating any issues that arose as quick as possible.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped 
1. **Communication Tools Overload:** - The use of multiple communication tools (Slack, Zoom, and instagram) led to information being scattered across platforms, causing some important updates to be missed or duplicated. This affected our ability to stay coordinated and efficient. Moving forward to future sprints, we will potentially consider narrowing our communication channels down to only Slack and Zoom, in hopes to reduce confusion and poor coordination.

2. **Underestimating Testing Time:** - We underestimated the amount of time required for thorough testing of new features. As a result, some bugs were discovered late in the iteration, leading to last-minute fixes and increased stress for the development team. Next sprint, we will attempt to discover these bugs sooner, allowing us more time to troubleshoot and fix any issues.

#### Planned changes 
1. **Dedicated Time for Documentation:** - Allocate specific time slots during our meetings for updating documentation to ensure it remains current. Even though our documentation keeping habits were much improved compared to sprint 1, we believe it will be even more efficient if we have a dedicated time to update documentation as a team.

2. **Enhanced Task Management:** - Continue refining our use of Jira for task management to improve task visualization and accountability. We understand that some of our subtasks and descriptions were a little vague, and so we will also attempt to work on this as a group and make them more detailed and accurate.


## Product - Review 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed: 
1. **Friend Request Feature (Harish Thevakumaran):** - Developed backend endpoints, integrated authentication, created the frontend component, and completed end-to-end testing of the friend request feature. 

2. **Search Functionality (Tamam Makki):** - Designed and implemented search UI, added filtering and sorting options, optimized backend search functionality, and completed integration and testing. 

3. **Recommendation System (Hamza Khalid):** - Built and enhanced recommendation algorithms, developed backend API, and created the frontend UI for displaying recommendations. Conducted testing for accuracy and relevance. 

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed: 
- N/A 

## Meeting Highlights 

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **Centralized Communication:** - To avoid scattered information, we need to streamline our communication by choosing a primary tool for updates and discussions, ensuring everyone is on the same page. By doing so, we hope that we can avoid hiccups similar to some that we had during this sprint.

2. **Accurate Time Estimation:** - It's crucial to allocate sufficient time for thorough testing and to avoid underestimating the effort required for new features. Better time estimation will help in managing workloads and deadlines more effectively, so that we are not left scrambling to finish our tasks within the final days of the sprint.
