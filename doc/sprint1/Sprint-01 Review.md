# Edu Prodigi



## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * **When:** June 15th, 2024
 * **Where:** Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection

During this iteration, our team worked on developing the core infrastructure for the Edu Prodigi platform, focusing on user registration and authentication, profile management, and the projects feature.

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. **Regular Online Meetings:**
   - Our decision to have daily online meetings on Zoom at 5:30 pm turned out to be very effective. These meetings allowed us to understand each other's roles and responsibilities, identify and resolve blockers quickly, and ensure alignment with iteration goals.

3. **Use of Task Boards:**
   - Utilizing Jira for task boards was successful in visualizing the progress of our tasks. It provided a clear view of what was completed, in progress, or pending, facilitating better task management and accountability.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Ad-hoc Coding Sessions:**
   - While ad-hoc coding sessions were meant to tackle complex issues through pair programming, they were difficult to coordinate due to varying availability. This led to some delays in addressing technical challenges.

2. **Documentation Management:**
   - We struggled with keeping our documentation up-to-date. Meeting notes and other documents were sometimes neglected, which made it difficult to refer back to decisions and discussions later on.

#### Planned changes

1. **Scheduled Pair Programming Sessions:**
   - To improve the effectiveness of our coding sessions, we plan to schedule them in advance rather than relying on ad-hoc sessions. This should help ensure better attendance and coordination.

2. **Improved Documentation Practices:**
   - We will implement a more rigorous documentation process, ensuring that meeting notes and other important documents are updated regularly and stored in an easily accessible location.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **Scheduled Coordination is Key:**
   - Ensuring that all team members are available for scheduled coding sessions and meetings is crucial for maintaining progress and addressing issues promptly.

2. **Documentation Must Be Up-to-date:**
   - Keeping our documentation current is essential for tracking progress and making informed decisions. We need to allocate time specifically for documentation updates.

4. **Continual Improvement of Processes:**
   - Regularly evaluating and refining our processes will help us become more efficient and effective as a team.
